# Sub-servicing
Made for ludum dare 48 in a team of 3. Theme: Deeper and Deeper

You play as a lone submarine captain/gunner/firstmate/serviceman on a quest to go as 
deep into the ocean as you possibly can, as you descend more and more issues become 
frequent on the submarine that the player must fix until the player is 
overwhelmed at the sheer amount of problems occuring and succums to the depths

Created in Unity with Oísin and Cillín Ivory.
